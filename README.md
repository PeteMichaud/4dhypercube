4 Dimensional Hypercube Javascript Toy
===========

I wrote a thing I called "[hypercube](https://github.com/PeteMichaud/hypercube)" years ago, way before people were doing
things with javascript. It used some matrix math to place 27 vertices forming a cube onto the screen,
with rotation and zooming. It was cute, I thought. Then people gave me shit because it's actually just a 3D cube, not
really a hypercube, and further, said critics, it was just the vertices, and poorly placed at that.

This one is literally a hypercube, and you can bet your ass it has more than vertices. Think of it as a poetic fuck you,
I can make whatever hypercube I want. Also, thanks, because something about being dismissed inspires me to do more.
